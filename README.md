# Time-of-flight
a simple encoder-decoder network used to filter raw tof depth
The neetwork was trained on the dataset provided by
    DeepToF: Off-the-Shelf Real-Time Correction of Multipath Interference in Time-of-Flight Imaging
    Julio Marco, Quercus Hernandez, Adolfo Mu√±oz, Yue Dong, Adrian Jarabo, Min H. Kim, Xin Tong, Diego Gutierrez
    ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol.36(6)

For more details on the data generation please refer to the full paper:http://webdiis.unizar.es/~juliom/pubs/2017SIGA-DeepToF/

And you can download the whole dataset from above link.
First, run tfrecords.py to generate train.tfrecords and test.tfrecords. To generate test.tfrecords, you should do a little 
change to tfrecords.py.
Then, run tof_train.py and tof_eval.py to get the result.
Here are two results:
